# Self-Assessment

## Cohesive written analysis:

My role in this project is explained below:

### Segment 1 
- Organised GitHub repository and branches,
- Started to PowerPoint slide show 
- Submitted Segment 1

### Segment 2
- We updated the Read me file with Timothy Channer and Gokcen Aydin,
- We prepared a draft Web page to predict the house sales price (But then the team decided to visualize the project with Tableau, so we did not use that draft page.)
- I submitted Segment 2

### Segment 3

- Updated the PowerPoint presentation with Gokcen Aydin.
- Created a web page from the House Prediction GitHub repository.
- Submitted segment 3

My greatest challenge in the project was losing my little dog then. So it took a lot of time to concentrate on the job. But our team was with me, and they helped me.

## Cohesive written summary:
- I attended the Sunday meetings and the classes to do my best at each project segment. This also helped me understand all the steps and be in the project.
- I reviewed all the codes to understand them and to resume the project.

# Project and Team Summary

We prepared a project schedule to delegate all the tasks. This schedule aided in time management. Additionally, weâ€™ve communicated with slack to inform the team of all the steps. 

### Planning and revisions:
We made the plan at the beginning, but we revised it while preparing it. We were an excellent team with different strengths.

### Machine Learning Models used:
 - Random Forest
 - Multiple Linear Regression
 
### The Result

The most significant result of this project is the age of the houses. The newest homes are selling at the highest price
